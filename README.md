# ðŸŒŸ Early Stage Projects

During my early learning phase, I built several small projects to strengthen my fundamentals in *HTML, CSS, and JavaScript*.
These projects may look simple, but they helped me *grasp the core concepts of programming, problem-solving, and UI/UX design*, which later became the stepping stones to working on more advanced applications.

## ðŸ“Œ Projects Overview

ðŸ§® 1. Simple Calculator

* *Tech Stack:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* *Description:*
  A web-based calculator capable of performing basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). The UI was designed to resemble a physical calculator with clickable buttons.
* *Key Features:*

  * Supports basic math operations.
  * Clear and reset functionalities.
  * Minimal and clean UI.
* *My Growth & Learnings:*

  * Understood *DOM manipulation* in detail.
  * Learned to handle *user input and validation*.
  * Improved understanding of *functions and event handling* in JavaScript.


âœ… 2. To-Do List

* *Tech Stack:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* *Description:*
  A simple task management application where users can add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them when no longer needed.
* *Key Features:*

  * Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks.
  * Tasks stored in *local storage* for persistence.
  * Interactive UI with task completion indicators.
* *My Growth & Learnings:*

  * Practiced implementing *CRUD operations* on the frontend.
  * Learned about *local storage* for saving data.
  * Understood the importance of *user-friendly workflows*.

ðŸ–¼ 3. Gallery Website

* *Tech Stack:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* *Description:*
  A simple responsive gallery showcasing images with hover animations and a grid-based layout. Designed to test *CSS skills* and image handling.
* *Key Features:*

  A browser-based recreation of the classic *Connect Four* game for two players. The goal is to drop discs into a grid and connect four in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally).
* *Key Features:*

  * Two-player functionality.
  * Detection of winning patterns (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).
  * Dynamic and interactive gameplay with animations.
* *My Growth & Learnings:*

  * Built logic using *2D arrays and loops*.
  * Learned *win-condition algorithms*.
  * Improved ability to structure larger codebases.


ðŸŽµ 5. Simon Game

* *Tech Stack:* HTML, CSS, JavaScript
* *Description:*
  A memory challenge game where the player repeats color patterns shown by the game. With every round, the sequence becomes longer, testing memory and reaction time.
* *Key Features:*

  * Random sequence generation.
  * Increasing difficulty with each round.
  * Visual + sound feedback on button press.
* *My Growth & Learnings:*

  * Learned *timers and event-driven programming*.

## ðŸŒ± How These Projects Helped Me Grow

Building these projects step by step helped me:

* *Master the basics* of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
* Improve *logical thinking* and ability to break problems into smaller tasks.
* Gain *hands-on practice* with event listeners, DOM manipulation, and responsive design.
* Build confidence to take on *bigger projects* using advanced tools and frameworks like *React, Node.js, MongoDB*.
* Understand the *importance of UI/UX* while designing user-friendly applications.

Each project gave me not just technical knowledge but also the *discipline of debugging, testing, and improving continuously*. These experiences became the stepping stones that shaped me into a more confident developer.

----

After completing these beginner projects, I gradually moved to:

* Exploring *JavaScript frameworks* like React.
* Learning *backend development* with Node.js and databases.
* Building *full-stack applications* with real-world use cases.

These early projects remind me how small steps lead to *big progress*.
